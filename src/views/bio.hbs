                Amie is an interdisciplinary artist based in the Pacific Northwest, working primarily in painting and collage. Her work explores themes of consumption, connection, and clutter through expressive depictions of everyday spaces and objects. Guided by an intuitive process and a sensitivity to the unpredictable nature of oil painting, Amie finds inspiration in the messy and often overlooked moments that shape our routines.

                Through richly layered compositions, she captures the tension between chaos and calm—the dirty dishes, scattered belongings, and fleeting gestures that carry quiet emotional weight. Her work invites viewers to consider their own relationships with the spaces and materials that surround them, finding meaning in the unremarkable and connection in the imperfect.
